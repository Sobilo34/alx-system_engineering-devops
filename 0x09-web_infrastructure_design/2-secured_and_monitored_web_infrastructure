Reason for adding more features/elements:
In this Secured Web Infrastructure, we are meant to add Firewalls, SSH certificate and Monitoring Clients. This will protect the web server from unathorized access, getting access to critical informationby a third-party and improve good analyzation of data for optimal user outcome.
What are firewalls for:
Firewall arhe things that protects Web server and network against unauthorized access, viruses, and hackers by monitoring network traffic.
SSH Certificates: Enhance security by providing identity-based authentication and automatic expiration.
Monitoring Clients: Streamline operations, improve communication, and analyze data for better client outcomes. üî•üîëüîç
Why is the traffic served over HTTPS
What monitoring is used for
How the monitoring tool is collecting data
Explain what to do if you want to monitor your web server QPS
You must be able to explain what the issues are with this infrastructure:
Why terminating SSL at the load balancer level is an issue
Why having only one MySQL server capable of accepting writes is an issue
Why having servers with all the same components (database, web server and application server) might be a problem
